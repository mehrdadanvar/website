      <span class="text-4xl">I</span>
      was born at the end of the 8-year conflict between Iran and Iraq in a
      small town to the southwest of Iran. My mother who was the head of school
      of nursing at the time was on the final year of graduating from Tehran
      University of Medical Sciences. Growing up in an academic family, I
      developed a natural inclination towards comprehending the intricacies of
      the human body and health. My passion for these subjects led me to pursue
      high school biology and eventually, medical school.

    <p class="my-3">
      Through eight years of rigorous medical education at
      <span class="italic">"Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"</span>, and
      participation in various research projects, my perspective on healthcare
      evolved. Although treating patients was a crucial aspect of my everyday
      work, I yearned for a more significant role in promoting health at the
      population level. However, the curriculum primarily focused on training
      clinicians to manage long queues of impatient patients, leaving little
      room for research. To address this issue, I formulated a long-term plan
      for self-education with two primary pillars that serve as the foundation
      of my educational and professional aspirations.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3">
      Firstly, I prioritized building and maintaining a robust understanding of
      research methodology by attending university workshops that guided me in
      learning statistics and quantitative reasoning. This was a turning point
      as I became familiar withcomputer science and programming

      which later became my interests. Secondly, I sought to enhance my
      theoretical knowledge by voluntarily participating in drafting and editing
      my peers' projects and seniors' dissertations. I later provided
      consultancy in developing research proposals from raw ideas, and I gained
      expertise in analyzing datasets in the context of each project.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3">
      By the end of the eighth year, I had fortified my core skills by
      participating in a variety of study types, ranging from simple narrative
      reviews to clinical trials. Today, I am a nerdy medical professional with
      an understanding of healthcare at both the clinical and population levels.
