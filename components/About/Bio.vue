      y journey began with being born to a mother who studied public health and
      worked as a nurse. Growing up in an academic family, I developed a natural
      inclination towards comprehending the intricacies of the human body and
      health. My passion for these subjects led me to pursue high school biology
      and eventually, medical school.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3">
      After eight years of rigorous medical school and participation in various
      research projects, my perspective on healthcare evolved. Although treating
      patients was a crucial aspect of my everyday work, I yearned for a more
      significant role in promoting health at the population level. However, the
      curriculum primarily focused on training clinicians to manage long queues
      of impatient patients, leaving little room for research. To address this
      issue, I formulated a long-term plan for self-education with two primary
      pillars that serve as the foundation of my educational and professional
      aspirations.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3">
      Firstly, I prioritized building and maintaining a robust understanding of
      research methodology by attending university workshops that guided me in
      learning statistics and quantitative reasoning. Secondly, I sought to
      enhance my theoretical knowledge by voluntarily participating in drafting
      and editing my peers' projects and seniors' dissertations. I later
      provided consultancy in developing research proposals from raw ideas, and
      I gained expertise in analyzing datasets in the context of each project.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3">
      By the end of the eighth year, I had fortified my core skills by
      participating in a variety of study types, ranging from simple narrative
      reviews to clinical trials. Today, I am an accomplished medical
      professional with a comprehensive understanding of healthcare at both the
      clinical and population levels. My experiences have instilled in me a deep
      passion for advancing health outcomes through evidence-based research and
      interventions.
