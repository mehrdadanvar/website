      <span class="text-4xl">I</span>
      was born at the end of the 8-year conflict between Iran and Iraq in a
      small town to the southwest of Iran. My mother who was the head of school
      of nursing at the time was on the final year of graduating from the Tehran
      Univer Growing up in an academic family, I developed a natural inclination
      towards comprehending the intricacies of the human body and health. My
      passion for these subjects led me to pursue high school biology and
      eventually, medical school.

    <p class="my-3">
      Through eight years of rigorous medical education at
      <span class="italic">"Shiraz University of Medical Sciences"</span>, and
      participation in various research projects, my perspective on healthcare
      evolved. Although treating patients was a crucial aspect of my everyday
      work, I yearned for a more significant role in promoting health at the
      population level. However, the curriculum primarily focused on training
      clinicians to manage long queues of impatient patients, leaving little
      room for research. To address this issue, I formulated a long-term plan
      for self-education with two primary pillars that serve as the foundation
      of my educational and professional aspirations.

    <p class="my-3">
      Firstly, I prioritized building and maintaining a robust understanding of
      research methodology by attending university workshops that guided me in
      learning statistics and quantitative reasoning. Secondly, I sought to
      enhance my theoretical knowledge by voluntarily participating in drafting
      and editing my peers' projects and seniors' dissertations. I later
      provided consultancy in developing research proposals from raw ideas, and
      I gained expertise in analyzing datasets in the context of each project.
    </p>
    <p class="my-3">
      By the end of the eighth year, I had fortified my core skills by
      participating in a variety of study types, ranging from simple narrative
      reviews to clinical trials. Today, I am an accomplished medical
      professional with a comprehensive understanding of healthcare at both the
      clinical and population levels. My experiences have instilled in me a deep
      passion for advancing health outcomes through evidence-based research and
      interventions.
