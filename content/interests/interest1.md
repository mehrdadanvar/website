# Programming

As a doctor and health researcher, my passion for programming is fueled by the transformative potential it holds in revolutionizing healthcare. Through learning programming, I have found how computer sciences facilitate the flow of information at the fingertips of our professionals. whether it's developing algorithms to analyze large datasets for medical research or creating software tools to streamline patient care and diagnosis. The intersection of medicine and technology is where I enjoy the most, as it combines my nerdy computer science enthusiast with the academic research interests. Programming empowers me to be not just a healthcare practitioner, but also a catalyst for positive change in the field, driving progress towards a healthier, more connected world.

But how do you (I) go about learning such a vast field without attending college or university? The answer lies simply in the art of youtube and documentation websites as their vibrant community of engineers, developers and content creators tirelessly work to produce one of the largest mankind's achievements. open source quality education!!!
