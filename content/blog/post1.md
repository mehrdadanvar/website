# Six Reasons Why Windows Loses the Competition to Linux in This Year!

A five-minute read by Mehrdad Anvar
The battle between operating systems has been a long-standing debate, with each one boasting unique features that set it apart from the competition. In this article, we will explore 6 reasons for using Linux over Windows and how these advantages can impact your overall computing experience.

## Security & Privacy

Linux is known for its robust security features, making it less susceptible to malware attacks compared to Windows. The open-source nature of Linux allows for quick identification and resolution of vulnerabilities, unwanted loggers, and privacy intruder programs while Windows' closed ecosystem may lead to delays in addressing potential issues.
In Linux, users have greater control over their system's configurations, with the ability to inspect and modify the source code, fostering transparency and trust. The permission system in Linux is more granular, allowing users to finely tune access controls, limiting potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, Linux distributions typically have a stronger focus on user privacy and data security, with built-in encryption tools and secure protocols. Since Linux is less targeted by malware and viruses compared to Windows, users generally experience fewer privacy threats.
so there are things to be done!

## Customization

Linux offers a high degree of customizability, allowing users to tailor their desktop environment to suit their preferences. With access to various distributions, desktop environments, and window managers, it is possible to choose an operating system that closely aligns with your needs and work style. Windows, on the other hand, has more standardized settings and interfaces designed to appeal to the masses. New users should stay informed of the possible “Customization Hell” where a person falls trapped to the unlimited methods of changing their interface, spending a stupendous amount of time on visuals, and getting little done by the end of their work day.

## Costs

While Windows requires a paid license for most of its versions, Linux distributions are almost always free to use and distribute, except for enterprise users who intend to run cloud services. This cost-effectiveness can be particularly appealing for schools, businesses, or individuals with tight budgets, making Linux an attractive alternative to the pricier Windows options. Thanks to its core developed by Linus Torvalds an engineer interested in tinkering with hardware, Linux has already baked-in drivers for the vast majority of available or older hardware, saving its users from unnecessary hardware purchases and thus reducing our consumeristic non-echo-friendly shopping habits.

## Stability

Linux is known for its reliability and stability compared to Windows. The kernel design in Linux allows for better handling of hardware resources and processes, resulting in fewer system crashes and slower performance degradation over time. Windows users may experience more frequent slowdowns and instability as their operating systems age or become cluttered with software updates and temporary files. It should be kept in mind that new Linux users are well-known for breaking their operating system due to unfamiliarity with the inner workings of Linux leading to rounds of trial and error.

## Performance

There is no ad-ware running by default on Linux systems as is the case with Microsft Windows. Moreover, Linux distributions generally have lower system requirements compared to their Windows counterparts, allowing for smoother operation on older hardware. There are Linux distributions that require less than one Gigabyte of RAM and 8 Gigabytes of disk storage to function properly. Additionally, Linux is known for its efficient memory management and quick boot times, making it an excellent choice for those looking for a snappy, responsive operating system that consumes a relatively low amount of power.

## Community Support

The open-source nature of Linux fosters a strong community of developers, users, and enthusiasts who actively contribute to the improvement and support of the operating system. This community provides extensive resources, documentation, and forums to help new users navigate their transition to Linux and troubleshoot any issues they may encounter. However, there might be a small yet incredibly vocal set of elitist users in the community who are notoriously known for trolling new users, not being helpful to the overall state of the ecosystem.

## conclusion

While Windows remains a popular choice among many users, Linux offers numerous advantages that make it a compelling alternative. With its enhanced security features, customizable interface, cost-effectiveness, stability, performance benefits, and strong community support, it is clear to see why an increasing number of people are making the switch to Linux for their computing needs.
