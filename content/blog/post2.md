## Acute Appendicitis

A 35-year-old patient presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of worsening abdominal pain
localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) over the past 12 hours. The pain is dull, constant, and aggravated by
walking or deep breathing. The patient reports nausea, anorexia, and a low-grade fever of 38.5°C (101.3°F). On
physical examination, rebound tenderness is present in the RLQ, as well as guarding. Which finding is most
consistent with the presentation of acute appendicitis?

1. A palpable mass in the RLQ
2. Normal abdominal exam findings
3. Absent rebound tenderness and guarding
4. Mild left-sided abdominal pain
5. Severe epigastric pain

Answer: A) rebound tenderness and guarding are classic signs of acute appendicitis. Other common symptoms include
nausea, anorexia, fever, and RLQ abdominal pain that worsens with movement or deep breathing. The presence of a
palpable mass in the RLQ is not always present in all cases of appendicitis.

## Acute Cholecyctits

A 60-year-old patient presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of severe right upper quadrant
(RUQ) abdominal pain that worsens after eating. The patient also reports feeling nauseous and vomiting bile. On
physical examination, the patient appears dehydrated, and there is localized tenderness in the RUQ without rebound
tenderness or guarding. The patient's laboratory results reveal an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 14,000
cells/mcL with a left shift. Which diagnosis is most consistent with this presentation?

1. Acute appendicitis
2. Acute pancreatitis
3. Cholangitis
4. Acute cholecystitis
5. Peptic ulcer disease

Answer: D) The patient's symptoms of RUQ abdominal pain worsening after eating, nausea and vomiting bile,
localized tenderness without rebound or guarding, and laboratory findings of an elevated WBC with a left shift are
consistent with the presentation of acute cholecystitis. Acute appendicitis typically presents with RLQ abdominal
pain that worsens with movement or deep breathing, while peptic ulcer disease usually causes epigastric pain and
may be associated with food intake but without the systemic signs described in this presentation. Cholangitis is a
more severe complication of cholelithiasis, often presenting with jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain that may
radiate to the back.

## Acute Pancreatitis

A 45-year-old patient presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of sudden onset of severe
epigastric pain radiating to the back. The patient reports nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. On physical
examination, there is generalized abdominal tenderness without localized tenderness or rebound tenderness.
Laboratory results reveal an elevated amylase level of 2000 IU/L. Which diagnosis is most consistent with this
presentation?

1. Acute appendicitis
2. Acute cholecystitis
3. Peptic ulcer disease
4. Acute pancreatitis
5. Intestinal obstruction

Answer: D) The patient's symptoms of sudden onset of severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, nausea,
vomiting, decreased appetite, and laboratory findings of an elevated amylase level are consistent with the
presentation of acute pancreatitis. Acute appendicitis typically presents with RLQ abdominal pain that worsens
with movement or deep breathing, while acute cholecystitis usually causes RUQ abdominal pain that worsens after
eating. Peptic ulcer disease may cause epigastric pain, but it is not typically associated with the systemic signs
described in this presentation. Intestinal obstruction can present with abdominal pain and decreased appetite, but
it typically causes localized abdominal tenderness and often a palpable mass or distension.
