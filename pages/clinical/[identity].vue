    Description: As a dedicated Family Physician and Primary Health Care Consultant, I provided comprehensive
    healthcare services to a rural population in Shiraz, Fars, Iran. My responsibilities included monitoring
    the health status of approximately 10,000 individuals, with a strong focus on essential healthcare areas
    such as family planning, immunization, and pediatric care. I played a vital role in educating and
    assisting families in making informed choices regarding family planning and ensured that children received
    timely and essential immunizations to prevent communicable diseases. Additionally, I managed cases of
    chronic diseases, particularly those related to diabetes and hypertension, by offering expert medical
    advice, monitoring patients' progress, and developing personalized treatment plans. My commitment to
    delivering high-quality healthcare services, even in the challenging context of a rural setting, allowed
    me to make a positive impact on the health and well-being of the local community. My experience in this
    role has deepened my understanding of the unique healthcare needs of rural populations and strengthened my
    ability to provide compassionate, effective, and culturally sensitive medical care.
